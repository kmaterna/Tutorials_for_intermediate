# Tutorials_for_intermediate

This repository holds examples, tutorials, and toy problems for learning intermediate topics in geophysical data analysis. One example is the new pygmt interface with GMT6 and Python3.6+. 

### Tool 1: Pygmt ###
#### Pygmt mapping can: ####
* Download topography using GMT6 capabilities and plot with grdimage (may only work when connected to Internet?)
* Add illumination with one command! (-I+d)
* Provide the familiar annotations using GMT syntax
* Place scale bar, legend, and color bar using geographic coordinates, justified, and normalized coordinates
* Label the color bar differently on x and y axes
* Make legends similar to GMT legends
* Save the map as a PNG or other formats

Example map built in Python using pygmt (code included):
